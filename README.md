# Property-Management-System
Property Management System (Nithira) is a full-stack web application created to give
real estate and physical property management professionals access to online property
management tools. The front-end frameworks for the application include Ionic 6+ and Angular
13+, with Leaflet 1.7+ for map display and ChartJS 3.5+ for data visualization. Node.js, Fastify
3+, and MongoDB are used to build the backend. The application offers a complete platform for
managing properties, tenant information, and real estate transactions and seeks to connect
property managers with prospective buyers. A user-friendly dashboard allows property managers
to manage tenant and lease information as well as create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)
properties. Additionally, the dashboard offers real-time analytics and reporting tools that support
managers in making wise choices. Property seekers can look for homes using a variety of filters,
including location, cost, and property type. Both the property listing page and the property details
page in the application offer in-depth details on each property, including pictures, descriptions,
and other crucial information. The application has features like user authentication and
authorization, data encryption, and input validation that guarantee the security of the user's data.
Additionally, it has a notification system that informs users of any important updates or
modifications to their properties.
